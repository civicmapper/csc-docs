###### The QVCOG ArcGIS Online Organization consists of an overarching administrator account and individual municipality accounts. 

*   The QVCOG ArcGIS Online administrator is in charge of updating common shared files like parcel boundaries and maintaining order.

*   Each municipality is in charge of creating data for its own use and organizing and sharing its own feature classes and maps as appropriate.
