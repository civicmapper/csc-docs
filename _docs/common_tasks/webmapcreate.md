There are several ways to create a WebMap using ArcGIS Online. One easy way is to use the ArcGIS Online website to open a blank map and add and symbolize data using the web interface.

#### Opening a New Map

1.  Log in to the ArcGIS Online website
2.  Navigate to the ‘Map’ window.

#### Adding Content

###### Adding Content from Your Account

1.  Click the **Add** drop down menu and choose **Search for Layers**. 
    *   The Search tool automatically filters the search for feature classes in your content only. 

2.  Click on the little plus sign in the bottom right hand corner to add a layer to your map, or click on the feature class to view more information about it.

3. Clicking the arrow in the top left corner of the Search box will navigate back to the Table of Content.

###### Adding Content from Other Sources

1.  Click the **Add** drop down menu and choose **Search for Layers**. 

2.  Remove or alter the **My content** filter at the top of the search box
    *   Search from a particular group, the Living Atlas, or publically available data from ArcGIS Online.

3. Clicking the arrow in the top left corner of the Search box will navigate back to the Table of Content.

#### Symbolizing Data

1.  Click on the **Change Style** tool (represented by colorful shapes) directly under the layer name.

2.  Here a user can change the style of a feature class to visualize attribute data (contained in the feature class's attribute table). 
    *   To view a layer's attribute table, 

For example, if it would be useful to display parcels according to their Assessed Value Total, the user could choose value categories for which a parcel would be green, yellow, or red and symbolize accordingly.

#### Analyzing Data

Various **Analysis** tools are used to extract meaning and draw conclusions using spatial relationships between data. The button to locate these tools is located in the top menu bar (as well as under each feature class - represented by the mini map image).

Descriptions of each analysis tool as well as how-to guides from ESRI are available [here](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/analyze/perform-analysis.htm)

#### Saving Your Map

Once the data you are interested in is on the map, has been analyzed as required, and is displayed correctly, save the map to create a WebMap that can be re-accessed, edited, and shared. 

The WebMap will now be available in ‘Content’.

To share your map,
