WebApps are created from WebMaps. 

#### Creating a new WebApp

1.  Navigate to the WebMap containing the data you would like to use in your WebApp. 

2.  Click on **Create Web App**. 
    *   For beginners it is best to choose **Using a Template**.
    *   There are many WebApp Templates to choose from. Browse and explore the options to find which is best suited to your needs. 

3.  Once you have made your selection, click on that template and select **CREATE WEB APP**.

4.  Fill in the required fields. 
    *   It is good practice to include "WebApp" in the name of your new WebApp to differentiate the content from the WebMap used to create it.

#### Customizing Your WebApp

*   Most WebApp creation will involve filling and editing fields and choosing display options so that the WebApp is customized to suit the userâ€™s needs. 

*   Clicking **Launch** opens a new tab showing what the resulting App will look like. 
    *   If anything is incorrect or incomplete, simply close the App display tab and edit the relevant fields. 
    
*   Once the app is finished, click **Save** to create a shareable WebApp that will be available in your **Content**.

The App can be further edited at anytime.
