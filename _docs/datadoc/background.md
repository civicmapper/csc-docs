ESRI has created a variety of editable vector basemaps for use on ArcGIS Online. Users can customize the colors, look, and feel of the basemap using a style editor application created by ESRI for this purpose. 

Access the style editor [here:](https://developers.arcgis.com/vector-tile-style-editor/(modal:new))

Here's what the [ESRI Information Story Map](https://arcgis-content.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=e87a478be74e4593a9635a1ae79ca09a) says about the style editor: 

"There are 4 preview screens to see how your changes affect different scales. 

The 'Layers' option allows you to drill down into the layers of information on the map and change each individually, or by category.

An 'edit by color' option allows you to select all items with a specific color value and provide a universal color change.

The 'Quick Edit' option (shown above), allows you to make changes by broad groups of information. It includes a random color generator, which doesn't return a finished product, but is great for inspiration!"

Customize your basemap as much or as little as you like and then save your style for use in ArcGIS Online webmaps. See this ESRI [blog post](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/developers/mapping/design-custom-basemaps-with-the-new-arcgis-vector-tile-style-editor/) for some more information.
