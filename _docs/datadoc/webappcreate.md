*   Web Apps are created from Web Maps. 
*   The purpose of a Web App is to present the data created in a Web Map in a streamlined and focused platform viewable on any device or browser.

# Creating a new Web App

-  Navigate to the WebMap containing the data you would like to use in your Web App.

<br>
-  Click on **Create Web App**. 
    *   For beginners it is best to choose **Using a Template**.
    *   There are many Web App Templates to choose from. Browse and explore the options to find which is best suited to your needs.

-  Once you have made your selection, click on that template and select **CREATE WEB APP**.

<br>
-  Fill in the required fields. 
    *   It is good practice to include "WebApp" in the name of your new Web App to differentiate the content from the WebMap used to create it.

# Customizing Your Web App

-   Most Web App creation will involve filling and editing fields and choosing display options so that the Web App is customized to suit the user’s needs.

-   Clicking **Launch** opens a new tab showing what the resulting App will look like. 
    *   If anything is incorrect or incomplete, simply close the App display tab and edit the relevant fields.

-   Once the app is finished, click **Save** to create a shareable Web App that will be available in your **Content**.
